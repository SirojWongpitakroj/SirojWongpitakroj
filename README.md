# Hi there 👋

## Background:

I started falling in love with python in 2021 when I was 16. I learned to do OOP, DSA, LeetCode and many more. Not knowing what I want to be in the future despite falling in love with the language and problem-solving.

Until nearing the end of 2025, when I got assigned by my professor to create a website that utilize local Database (MySQL). I encounter HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, MySQL. I felt in love with it again and dedicated myself the learning Full-Stack Development

Moreover, in my University career I chose Data Science path and I am more confident in Python Language, Therefore I opt to mainly use Python as much as possible. 

Currently I focus on Front-end Development first. My tech stack will be HTML, CSS, Javascript(React), Python(Django).  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning on Front-end Development

Medium-Term Goal:

For the month of January, I dedicated myself to reinforce the javascript problem-solving

February, it will be the month of React and project-based learning

March, Learning Django and Sit for AWS Cloud Certificate Exam
